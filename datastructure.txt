Binary Tree
	Interview Skill
		#1: What do I already know:
			Tree is also a graph, an acyclic connected graph
	Height
		the largest # of edges in a path from a leaf node to a target node 
	Balanced Binary Tree
		the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more 			     
                than 1
	Recursive Approach
		Policy #1: What need to happen just in "Single Node"
		Policy #2: Base Case
		
Least Recently Used (LRU) cache
	Data Structure Implementations:
		1. Queue, suing a double linked list. 
		2. A Hash, with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.
	Paging
		a memory management scheme
		break physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames and logical memory into blocks of same size 			called pages.
	Reference a page
		If the page is in the memory: 
			detach the node of the list and bring it to the front of the queue.
		else:
			add a new node to the front of the queue
			update the corresponding node address in the hash
			if the queue is full
				remove a node from the rear of the queue
				add the new node to the front of the queue
