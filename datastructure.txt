Binary Tree
	Interview Skill
		#1: What do I already know:
			Tree is also a graph, an acyclic connected graph
	Height
		the largest # of edges in a path from a leaf node to a target node 
	Balanced Binary Tree
		the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more 			     
                than 1
	Recursive Approach
		Policy #1: What need to happen just in "Single Node"
		Policy #2: Base Case
		
Least Recently Used (LRU) cache
	Data Structure Implementations:
		1. Queue, suing a double linked list. 
		2. A Hash, with page number as key and address of the corresponding queue node as value.
	Paging
		a memory management scheme
		break physical memory into fixed-size blocks called frames and logical memory into blocks of same size 			called pages.
