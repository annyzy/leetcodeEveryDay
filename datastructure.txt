Binary Tree
	Height
		the largest # of edges in a path from a leaf node to a target node 
	Balanced Binary Tree
		the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more 			     
                than 1
	Recursive Approach
		Policy #1: What need to happen just in "Single Node"
		Policy #2: Base Case
